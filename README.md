## Usage

### Basic:


To use dioxus-spline, first you have to go to the Spline editor, click on the **Export** button, select "**Code**".

You should see something like this:

<img width="250" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/splinetool/react-spline/main/.github/screenshots/react-export-pane.png">

You can copy the URL and pass it to the `Spline` component in Dioxus:

```rust
use dioxus-spline::Spline

Spline {
  scene: String::from("https://prod.spline.design/6Wq1Q7YGyM-iab9i/scene.splinecode") 
}
```

You should be able to see the scene you exported in your Dioxus app.


### Advanced

You can also:
1. Query Spline objects via `SplineApplication.find_object_by_name` or `SplineApplication.find_object_by_id`.
2. Attach event listeners to any `SplineEvent`
3. Trigger Spline Events and modify Spline objects!
